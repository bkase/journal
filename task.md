# Fix State Management

**Status:** AwaitingCommit
**Agent PID:** 19962

## Original Todo

## 3. Fix State Management

**Priority:** Medium  
**Goal:** Remove environmental concerns from domain state.

### Steps

1. Remove `vault_path` from `SessionMetadata` struct
2. Update all functions that construct `SessionMetadata`
3. Ensure `EffectRunner` is the sole holder of `vault_path`
4. Update serialization/deserialization to exclude vault path
5. Fix all compilation errors from removed field

### Testing Strategy

- Verify session persistence works without vault_path
- Test session loading from different vault paths
- Ensure session state is purely domain-focused
- Verify no environmental data leaks into saved sessions

## Description

We're removing the `vault_path` field from the `SessionMetadata` struct to properly separate environmental concerns from domain state. Currently, the vault path is inappropriately stored in the session's domain data and gets persisted to disk, creating coupling between the business logic and infrastructure. The `EffectRunner` already manages the vault path for all I/O operations, making the field in `SessionMetadata` redundant and architecturally incorrect.

## Implementation Plan

Based on the codebase analysis, here's how we'll remove `vault_path` from the domain state:

- [x] Remove `vault_path` field from `SessionMetadata` struct in src/journal/src/state.rs:44-50
- [x] Update `JournalSession::new()` signature to remove vault_path parameter in src/journal/src/state.rs:105-111
- [x] Fix session creation in src/journal/src/update.rs:20-25 to not pass vault_path
- [x] Update test session creation in src/journal/src/update.rs:199-200, 224-225
- [x] Fix additional test cases in src/journal/src/effects.rs (6 more test functions)
- [x] Verify session serialization/deserialization works without vault_path in src/journal/src/effects.rs:168-231
- [x] Run `cargo build` and fix any remaining compilation errors
- [x] Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass (17 tests now passing)
- [x] Run `cargo clippy` to check for any linting issues (minor style warnings only)
- [x] User test: Create a new journal session and verify it saves/loads correctly without vault_path

## Notes

### Implementation Summary

Successfully removed `vault_path` from `SessionMetadata` struct, achieving proper separation of environmental concerns from domain state:

**Changes Made:**
- Removed `pub vault_path: String` field from `SessionMetadata` struct (state.rs:45)
- Updated `JournalSession::new()` to take only `SessionMode` parameter (state.rs:100)
- Removed vault_path acquisition logic from update.rs (lines 20-23) 
- Fixed all test cases in update.rs and effects.rs (8 total functions updated)
- Verified EffectRunner continues to properly manage vault_path for all I/O operations

**Architecture Improvements:**
- Domain state (`SessionMetadata`) now contains only business logic data
- Environmental data (`vault_path`) isolated to `EffectRunner` infrastructure layer  
- Session persistence no longer includes vault paths, improving portability
- Tests simplified as they no longer need to provide fake vault paths

**Validation Results:**
- All 29 tests pass (12 aethel-core + 17 journal tests)
- Clean build with no compilation errors
- Only minor style warnings from clippy (format string suggestions)
- Session serialization/deserialization works correctly without vault_path
- User test: Application runs successfully, vault initialization works correctly
- EffectRunner properly manages vault_path for all I/O operations without domain state coupling
