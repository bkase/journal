# GitHub Actions

**Status:** InProgress
**Agent PID:** 12070

## Original Todo

Implement github actions workflow -- look at external/aethel for an example of a similar setup.

## Description

Create a GitHub Actions CI workflow for the journal project that runs automated checks on every push and pull request. The workflow will ensure code quality through formatting, linting, testing, and build verification, following the patterns established in the Aethel subproject.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create rust-toolchain.toml in project root to pin Rust 1.88.0
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/ directory structure
- [ ] Create ci.yml workflow file with build_and_test job
- [ ] Configure workflow triggers for push and PR on main branch
- [ ] Set up mise installation and tool management steps
- [ ] Configure Rust component installation (rustfmt, clippy)
- [ ] Add make targets execution: fmt, lint, test, build
- [ ] Test workflow locally using act or by pushing to a branch
- [ ] Verify all checks pass and workflow runs successfully
